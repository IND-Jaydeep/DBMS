--Hotelmanagetn 1--
-- Step 1: Create the HotelManagement database (only needed in some DBMS like MySQL)
-- For Oracle, a schema is already created by default, so we do not need to create a separate database.
-- You can create tables within an existing schema or use an existing user.

-- Create the tables
CREATE TABLE Hotel (
    HotelNo INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    City VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Room (
    RoomNo INT PRIMARY KEY,
    HotelNo INT,
    Type VARCHAR(50),
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (HotelNo) REFERENCES Hotel(HotelNo)
);

CREATE TABLE Guest (
    GuestNo INT PRIMARY KEY,
    GuestName VARCHAR(100),
    GuestAddress VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Booking (
    HotelNo INT,
    GuestNo INT,
    DateFrom DATE,
    DateTo DATE,
    RoomNo INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (HotelNo, GuestNo, RoomNo),
    FOREIGN KEY (HotelNo) REFERENCES Hotel(HotelNo),
    FOREIGN KEY (GuestNo) REFERENCES Guest(GuestNo),
    FOREIGN KEY (RoomNo) REFERENCES Room(RoomNo)
);

-- Step 2: Insert sample data into tables

INSERT INTO Hotel (HotelNo, Name, City) VALUES (1, 'Grosvenor', 'London');
INSERT INTO Hotel (HotelNo, Name, City) VALUES (2, 'Hilton', 'New York');
INSERT INTO Hotel (HotelNo, Name, City) VALUES (3, 'Marriott', 'London');
INSERT INTO Hotel (HotelNo, Name, City) VALUES (4, 'Park Plaza', 'London');

INSERT INTO Room (RoomNo, HotelNo, Type, Price) VALUES (101, 1, 'Single', 100.00);
INSERT INTO Room (RoomNo, HotelNo, Type, Price) VALUES (102, 1, 'Double', 150.00);
INSERT INTO Room (RoomNo, HotelNo, Type, Price) VALUES (103, 2, 'Suite', 250.00);
INSERT INTO Room (RoomNo, HotelNo, Type, Price) VALUES (104, 3, 'Single', 80.00);
INSERT INTO Room (RoomNo, HotelNo, Type, Price) VALUES (105, 4, 'Double', 120.00);

INSERT INTO Guest (GuestNo, GuestName, GuestAddress) VALUES (1, 'Alice Brown', '123 Baker Street, London');
INSERT INTO Guest (GuestNo, GuestName, GuestAddress) VALUES (2, 'Bob Smith', '456 Queen’s Road, New York');
INSERT INTO Guest (GuestNo, GuestName, GuestAddress) VALUES (3, 'Charlie Green', '789 King’s Way, London');

INSERT INTO Booking (HotelNo, GuestNo, DateFrom, DateTo, RoomNo) VALUES (1, 1, TO_DATE('2024-10-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), TO_DATE('2024-10-05', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 101);
INSERT INTO Booking (HotelNo, GuestNo, DateFrom, DateTo, RoomNo) VALUES (1, 2, TO_DATE('2024-10-03', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), TO_DATE('2024-10-07', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 102);
INSERT INTO Booking (HotelNo, GuestNo, DateFrom, DateTo, RoomNo) VALUES (2, 3, TO_DATE('2024-10-02', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), TO_DATE('2024-10-04', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 103);

-- Step 3: Perform the SQL queries

-- Query 1: List full details of all hotels
SELECT * FROM Hotel;

-- Query 2: How many hotels are there?
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalHotels FROM Hotel;

-- Query 3: List the price and type of all rooms at the Grosvenor Hotel
SELECT Room.Type, Room.Price
FROM Room
JOIN Hotel ON Room.HotelNo = Hotel.HotelNo
WHERE Hotel.Name = 'Grosvenor';

-- Query 4: List the number of rooms in each hotel
SELECT Hotel.Name, COUNT(Room.RoomNo) AS NumberOfRooms
FROM Room
JOIN Hotel ON Room.HotelNo = Hotel.HotelNo
GROUP BY Hotel.Name;

-- Query 5: List all guests currently staying at the Grosvenor Hotel
SELECT Guest.GuestName, Guest.GuestAddress
FROM Guest
JOIN Booking ON Guest.GuestNo = Booking.GuestNo
JOIN Hotel ON Booking.HotelNo = Hotel.HotelNo
WHERE Hotel.Name = 'Grosvenor'
  AND CURRENT_DATE BETWEEN Booking.DateFrom AND Booking.DateTo;

-- Query 6: List all double or family rooms with a price below £40.00 per night, in ascending order of price
SELECT Room.Type, Room.Price
FROM Room
WHERE (Room.Type = 'Double' OR Room.Type = 'Family')
  AND Room.Price < 40.00
ORDER BY Room.Price ASC;

-- Query 7: How many different guests have made bookings for August?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Booking.GuestNo) AS UniqueGuestsInAugust
FROM Booking
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM Booking.DateFrom) = 8
   OR EXTRACT(MONTH FROM Booking.DateTo) = 8;

-- Query 8: What is the total income from bookings for the Grosvenor Hotel today?
SELECT SUM(Room.Price) AS TotalIncomeToday
FROM Booking
JOIN Room ON Booking.RoomNo = Room.RoomNo
JOIN Hotel ON Booking.HotelNo = Hotel.HotelNo
WHERE Hotel.Name = 'Grosvenor'
  AND CURRENT_DATE BETWEEN Booking.DateFrom AND Booking.DateTo;

-- Query 9: What is the most commonly booked room type for each hotel in London?
SELECT Hotel.Name, Room.Type, COUNT(Booking.RoomNo) AS RoomCount
FROM Booking
JOIN Room ON Booking.RoomNo = Room.RoomNo
JOIN Hotel ON Booking.HotelNo = Hotel.HotelNo
WHERE Hotel.City = 'London'
GROUP BY Hotel.Name, Room.Type
ORDER BY Hotel.Name, RoomCount DESC;

-- Query 10: Update the price of all rooms by 5%.
UPDATE Room
SET Price = Price * 1.05;
